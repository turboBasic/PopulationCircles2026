// `data/registry.toml` read for the one thing a build needs of it: which file, and what that file must say
// about itself. Here rather than in the library because resolving a dataset is the shell's work — the
// library keeps taking a `Grid` and a `RasterSpec`, and `application.md` "Architecture" is why.
//
// A row is the only way `table build` learns what to read, which is what keeps the sentinel, the CRS and the
// six grid numbers spelled once — in the registry that owns them — rather than retyped on a command line.
//
// No `deny_unknown_fields`: the licence, the checksum and the attribution are keys this reader has no use
// for, and `python/src/population_circles/dataset_registry.py` forbids an unknown one — so a typo is caught
// by the reader that claims every field rather than by the one that claims eight.
