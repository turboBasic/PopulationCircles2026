// Every help surface the binary has, pinned byte for byte. `--help` is the whole of what a user reads
// before running anything, and it is assembled by clap from attributes spread across every flag group
// and command variant — so it is the one artefact a module split can change without a single behavioural
// test noticing. These snapshots are the net: they are written before the split and never accepted again.
//
// clap is built with `default-features = false` and no `wrap_help`, so this output does not depend on
// terminal width and the snapshots hold wherever they run. `--help` also carries no version string, so a
// version bump does not reach them.
//
// Snapshots live beside this file rather than in the library, which is what `commands.rs`'s header
// already notes about `FU-03`'s tripwire: it watches `crates/popcircles/src/snapshots/` and does not see
// a snapshot kept here. That is correct — a help string is not the wire format and does not bind
// `SCHEMA_VERSION`.
