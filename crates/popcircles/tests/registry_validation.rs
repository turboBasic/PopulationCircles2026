// The end-to-end run against the real dataset: the registry raster streamed into a table, and the
// smallest circle holding half the world's population searched for over it. `tests/registry_raster.rs`
// pins the reader against that file; this pins everything above the reader against it, which is the one
// thing no synthetic fixture can do — a fixture cannot disagree with the published prior art.
//
// **Decimated to 5 arcmin rather than full resolution, and that is a cost decision with a measured
// reason.** At full resolution one radius costs 207 s of which 13 s is CPU — the run is page faults
// against a 7.5 GB mmap — and a search over radius probes two dozen of them. So the cheap grid
// brackets and the expensive grid certifies: this test is the bracket, and the full-resolution
// certification of the same answer is recorded in issue #10 rather than run here.
//
// Skipped with a message rather than failed when the raster is an unfetched pointer, which is box 2 of
// issue #10. A `#[test]` cannot skip at runtime, so the skip is an early return that says why — the
// alternative being a red suite on every clone that has not run `mise run data:pull`.
//
// expect is what a test documents an invariant with; docs/ai/code.md allows it here.
