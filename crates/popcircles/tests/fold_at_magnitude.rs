// `smallest`'s predicate slack, measured against the arithmetic it bounds. The claim is that
// `circle::population`'s fold over a circle covering the whole grid stays within
// `predicate_slack_persons` of `Table::whole`'s single query — the two answers to the same population,
// one summed per row and one taken in four corners — at a magnitude where the sums actually round.
//
// The shape is ADR 0003's decimated grid, 4320 x 2160, with cells scaled so the total is a world's worth
// of people. Not the full-resolution shape: a `Table` there is 7.5 GB of payload, and the bound scales
// with the row count rather than jumping at some threshold, so measuring the formula at a tenth of the
// rows measures the formula. `full_resolution_table.rs` covers the same arithmetic one layer down and
// never holds a table for exactly this reason.
//
// Deselected, and `mise run test:fold` is what runs it: the payload is 74.7 MB and the build streams
// 9 331 200 cells, which is a cost the default suite should not carry per run.
//
// expect and unwrap are what a test documents an invariant with; docs/ai/code.md allows both here. The
// cast lints are allowed because each cast below is exact and says why at its site.
