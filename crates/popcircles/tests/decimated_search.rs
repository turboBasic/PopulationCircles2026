// The search over the shape the decimated table has — 2160 x 4320, the k=10 grid — built
// synthetically rather than decimated from anything, because `platform.md` "Testing" forbids a test that
// needs raster bytes to pass.
//
// Deselected, and `mise run test:search` is what runs it. The payload is 74.7 MB and the search walks a
// whole globe, which is a cost CI should not carry; what it pins that the unit tests cannot is that the
// bound actually fires at a size where pruning is the difference between seconds and hours.
//
// expect is what a test documents an invariant with; docs/ai/code.md allows it here.
