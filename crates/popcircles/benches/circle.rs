// What evaluating one circle costs — the innermost thing the search does, once per candidate centre, as
// one rectangle query per row the kernel spans.
//
// **Two figures, not one, and the second is the one a full-resolution run actually pays.** A table that
// fits in memory answers a four-corner query in nanoseconds; the full-resolution table is 7.5 GB, read by
// mmap on a machine that cannot hold it, and there the same query is a page fault. A benchmark reporting
// only the resident figure describes a run that never happens, so this reports the resident one from a
// table it builds and the mapped one from the cache under `out/` when a full-resolution table is there.
//
// The mapped half is skipped with a message rather than failed when that cache is absent: it needs
// `mise run data:get` and a build, and neither is something a benchmark should do behind a caller's back.
//
// expect is what a benchmark documents an invariant with, the same licence `docs/ai/code.md` grants a
// test.
