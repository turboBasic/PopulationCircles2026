// A step arrives as a decimal from a geotransform and need not round-trip to the rational it
// means, so a span computed from one lands a few ulps off the whole number it is meant to hit —
// past -90 for a grid that in fact ends at the pole, short of 360 for one that in fact closes on
// itself. The size is what keeps this from swallowing a real discrepancy: being out by one cell
// costs 1/120° on the finest grid here, eight orders of magnitude above this.
//
// The registry raster is what fixes the scale rather than a guess: its step is 1/120 + 5.4e-16 and
// its origin latitude 90 + 1.16e-11, so the width times the step overshoots a full turn by 2.3e-11.
// pub(crate) because the raster reader compares a file's geotransform against a declared grid and
// has to allow exactly the same rounding this does — a second constant there would be two answers to
// one question.
